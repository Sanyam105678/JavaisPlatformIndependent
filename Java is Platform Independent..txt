Why Java is platform independent?
-> Java source code is the code written by the developer. It is converted into byte code by the compiler(javac) and byte code is platform 
independent. Java Virtual Machine (JVM) converts the byte code into appropriate platforms suitable code & JVM takes care of all the hardware
 issues. That's why Java is platform independent.
